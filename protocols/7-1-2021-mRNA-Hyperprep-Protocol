# KAPA mRNA Hyperprep Kit (1/2 reactions)
 
 ## mRNA Capture
 
* Prepare libraries and sample pools
* Prepare Fragment, Prime, and Elution Buffer (1X), 1st Strand Synthesis Buffer, 2nd Strand Synthesis, Ligation Master Mix
* Suspend RNA, 19.42 ul total volume
* add 6.58 ul of RNAse free water
* Add 26.25 ul of resuspended mRNA capture beads to each library (3)
* Place tube w/ capture beads on magnet and incubate at room temperature until clear
* Remove and discard supernatant, replace immediately with equal volume mRNA bead binding buffer (26.25 ul per library)
* Remove tube from magnet, resuspend beads in bead binding buffer and place back on magnet and incubate at room temperature until clear
* Remove and discard supernatant, replace immediately with equal volume mRNA bead binding buffer (26.25 ul per library)
* Remove and discard supernatant
* Transfer 25 ul of resuspended mRNA capture beads to each library sample tube
* Add 50 ul of sample to each tube and resuspend
* Place tube in Thermocycler for 1st mRNA capture
* Place tube on magnet and remove supernatant
* Resuspend beads in 25 ul of RNAse free water
* Incubate at 20C in Thermocycler for 5 min
* Place on magnet and remove supernatant
* Remove from magnet and resuspend in 100ul of mRNA bead wash buffer
* Place on magnet and remove supernatant
* Resuspend capture beads with mRNA in 11 ul FPE buffer
* Send to Thermocycler:
** 100-200 bp -> 8 min 94C
** 200-300 bp -> 6 min 94C
** 300-400 bp -> 6 min 85C
* Immediately place on magnet, remove 10 ul supernatant and place in separate tube
* Place tube on ice and proceed to 1st Strand Synthesis
