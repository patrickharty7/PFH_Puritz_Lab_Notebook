# DNA-RNA-Extraction

## Extraction Protocol:
* Add **800μL DNA/RNA shield** to 2mL Bead Tubes
* Remove samples and add 2mL Bead Tubes with solution
* Homogenize in Tissuelizer for **2 min at 30 Hertz**
* Remove samples from Tissuelizer
* Add **80μL of PK Buffer** to each, Vortex after adding
* Add **40μL of Prote K** to each, Vortex after adding
* Add samples to Thermomixer for **30 min (32 Degrees C, 600 RPM)**
* Remove samples from Thermomixer
* Remove Supernatant from Bead Tube samples, using P1000
* Place Supernatant in 1.5mL Tubes **(Approximately 850μL)**, Centrifuge **(2min at 16,000rcf)**
* Place Supernatant in new 5mL Tubes, **keep cell pellet intact**
* Add Equal Volume DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer **(Approximately 850μL)**, Vortex
* Total of 1700μL, move to DNA/RNA Purification

### DNA Purification Protocol:
* Transfer all liquid in 5mL tube to spin-away filter **(In 700μL increments)**
* Centrifuge for **1 min at 16,000rcf**
* Add **flow through** to **new** 5mL tube **(Proceed to RNA Purification Protocol)**
* Add **400μL prep buffer** to spin-away filter
* Centrifuge again **(1 min at 16,000rcf)**, discard flow-through
* Add **700μL wash buffer**, Centrifuge **(1min at 16,000rcf)** and discard flow through
* Add **400μL wash buffer**, Centrifuge **(2min at 16,000rcf)** and discard flow through
* Transfer spin-away column to new 1.5mL labeled tube
* Add **50μL of 10mm trisHCL at 32 C directly** to spin-away filter column, let stand **15 min**, Centrifuge **(30 sec at 16,000rcf)**, **Repeat twice**
* Collection and Quantification

### RNA Purification Protocol:
* Use 5mL tube **with flow through** from **Step 3** in DNA Purification Protocol
* Add **Equal Volume** of 100% Ethanol **(800μL)**
* Add **400μL wash buffer** to 5mL tube
* Centrifuge **(1min at 16,000rcf)** and discard flow through
* Add **80μL DNAase reaction mix** to each sample
* Incubate samples **(15min at room temp)**
* Add **400μL prep-buffer** to lllCG tube
* Centrifuge **(1min at 16,000rcf)** and discard flow through
* Add **700μL wash buffer**, Centrifuge **(1min at 16,000rcf)** and discard flow through
* Add **400μL wash buffer**, Centrifuge **(2min at 16,000rcf)** and discard flow through
* Transfer 111CG column to new 1.5mL tube
* Add **50μL of nuclease-free water 32 degrees**, let stand for 1min, Centrifuge **(30sec at 16,000rcf)**
* Collection and Quantification
