# DNA-RNA-Extraction

## Extraction Protocol:
* Add **800μL DNA/RNA shield** to 2mL Bead Tubes
* Remove samples and add 2mL Bead Tubes with solution
* Homogenize in Tissuelizer for **2 min at 30 Hertz**
* Remove samples from Tissuelizer
* Add **80μL of PK Buffer** to each, Vortex after adding
* Add **40μL of Prote K** to each, Vortex after adding
* Add samples to Thermomixer for **30 min (32 Degrees C, 600 RPM)**
* Remove samples from Thermomixer
* Remove Supernatant from Bead Tube samples, using P1000
* Place Supernatant in 1.5mL Tubes **(Approximately 850μL)**, Centrifuge **(16,000 RCF, 2min)**
* Place Supernatant in new 5mL Tubes, **keep cell pellet intact**
* Add Equal Volume DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer **(Approximately 850μL)**, Vortex
* Total of 1700μL, move to DNA/RNA Purification
