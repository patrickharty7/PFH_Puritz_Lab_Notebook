# KAPA mRNA Hyperprep
## Goals: 
* Make needed master mixes
* Collect and label tubes, organize work station
* Clean and make sure to designate areas for discarded supernatant, old tips
* Construct pooled samples and begin protocol

### Samples pooled into 19.42 ul each, 4000ng, 3 pools
* Once sample pools constructed, add 6.58 ul RNA-free water to each pool
* Suspend and mix mRNA capture beads (26.25 ul) into sample pools with RNA-free water
* Place tube on magnet and remove supernatant
* Add mRNA bead binding buffer to samples (26.25 ul)
* Remove tube on magnet and remove supernatant
* Add mRNA bead binding buffer to samples (26.25 ul) 
* Place tube on magnet and remove supernantant
* Add 25 ul of mRNA capture beads into each sample well tube
* Add 50 ul of sample to each tube and mix
* Place tube in thermocycler for 1st mRNA capture
* Remove from thermocycler and place on magnet, remove supernatant
* Resuspend in 25 ul of RNAse-free water
* Place tube in thermocycler for 2nd mRNA capture
* Add 25 ul bead binding buffer to tube, mix
* Incubate at 20C for 5 min in thermocycler
* Place on magnet and remove supernatant
* Remove from magnet and resuspend in 100 ul mRNA bead wash buffer
* Place tube on magnet and remove supernatant
* Prepare 33 ul of FPE (Fragment, Prime, and Elution) bufffer
* Resuspend capture beads in 11 ul FPE buffer
* Send to Thermocycler:
** 100-200 bp : 8 min 94C
** 200-300 bp : 6 min 94C
** 300-400 bp : 6 min 85C
* Immediately place on magnet, remove 10 ul of supernatant and place in separate tube
* Place on ice and proceed to 1st Strand Synthesis
